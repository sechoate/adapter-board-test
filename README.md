# Adapter Board Test
This is the Python code for testing Dune adapter boards. Additional requirements for running are a Raspberry Pi and a custom test board. 

## Additional Requirements 
There are two additional hardware requirements for running this code. First is a Raspberry Pi. During the writing of the code, a Raspberry Pi 3 model B V 1.2 was used. This is an important detail because if a different model is used then the numbering of the pins are not guarateed to be the same. The second requirement is a custom test board. The layout for the test board is included in the repoistory.
